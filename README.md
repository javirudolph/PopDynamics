# PopDynamics

Materials and development for a week-long workshop on population dynamics designed for upper level undergraduates.

## Learning objectives 
- Develop an understanding of basic population dynamics models
- Be able to estimate population parameters  

## Structure of this site 
To work through this workshop, download the package from Github. When you have the zip folder downloaded to your computer, extract it and when you open the folder, double click on the blue R icon with the file name `PopDynamics.Rproj`. This will open RStudio into the workshop's project and all necessary files will be within the same directory.
